A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

## Login

The application includes a fully functional Sign-In page, integrating Google Sign-In for seamless authentication. Additionally, it features a password reset functionality to enhance user account management.

## Welcome Screen

The application includes a Welcome Screen designed to provide users with an engaging first impression. It features dynamic content, including a brief introduction to the app, and offers navigation options to proceed to the Sign-In page or explore further. Additionally, the Welcome Screen displays a component list and includes four icons for navigating through multiple functions of the app:

- **Home**: Navigates to the Home screen.
- **Projects**: Displays the ongoing projects of the society.
- **Meetings**: Shows the scheduled and occurred meetings.
- **MOM**: Provides access to the Minutes of Meetings (MOM) for the same.

The Welcome Screen's component list provides a clear breakdown of the application's core functionality and has been designed to enhance user navigation and accessibility. Over time, the following updates have been made to the components:

- Added Google Sign-In for seamless authentication.
- Enhanced navigation icons to provide intuitive access to critical functionalities.
- Incorporated dynamic content on the Welcome Screen for an engaging user experience.
- Included a password reset feature for robust account recovery.
